      <h6 id="what-is-powercoders">What is Powercoders?</h6>

<p>Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees &amp; migrants. It consists of a coding bootcamp of 13 weeks and an internship that lasts 6 to 12 months. The ultimate goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments. While the project started in Switzerland, we now hope to grow and bring our impact to other cities across the world.

    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">How was Powercoders started?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>It all started with a trip to the United States. The American government invited an entrepreneur of each European country.</p>

<p>Founder Christian Hirsig met two entrepreneurs there, one with a cooking school for refugees, one with a coding academy for women. At this time, the refugee crisis in Europe was all over the news. Driven by the energy to help, the idea of Powercoders was born.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">Who can participate?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>Talented refugees and migrants, independent from their place of living, as long as they are allowed to travel.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">What does it cost?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>While the program is free for our participants, there are two main parties who support Powercoders. Firstly, companies donate money what is about 50% of our revenue. Secondly, Swiss cantons support Powercoders for every student who participates with CHF 7&rsquo;000–9&rsquo;000 what accounts for about 50% of the budget.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">How is Powercoders financed?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>Powercoders is a non profit organisation that depends on volunteers. To cover our costs, we are supported by the Swiss government, foundations, companies and individuals. However, Powercoders appreciates every donation.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">Why is coaching included?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>Our participants need more than technical knowledge in order to achieve a sustainable integration into employment. Entering a new workplace and culture, with many different expectations, can be intimidating and isolating. This is why our program includes a coach. Each participant is matched with a coach that is best suited for them, and they are then supported throughout their internship.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">Who can become a coach?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>Everyone who is a local in the specific city, motivated to learn about other cultures and willing to spend time with their mentee once every week. There are no IT skills needed, just an open and supportive attitude!</p>

    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">How long is the coaching period?</div>

        <div class="collapsible-header">Is a coach paid?</div>

        <div class="collapsible-header"> What kind of programming skills are being taught during the first 3 months in the coding bootcamp?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>Participants at Powercoders learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the first seven weeks. They also learn about GIT, UX and Agile Project Management. The second part of the course - after Career Day and internship placements - focuses more on server-side technologies,programming languages and frameworks that are being used by our internship companies.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>The best way is to offer an internship. If this is not possible for you, you can encourage your employees to join us as coaches or trainers or make a donation. Please <a href="mailto:info@powercoders.org">get in touch with us.</a></p>

        <div class="collapsible-header">Why offer an internship for Powercoders?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>An internship for Powercoders is a way to offer talented people from a refugee background the opportunity to access a doorway into the IT labour market of Switzerland. It is the unique chance for companies to get access to raw talent, get in touch with a person from a refugee background, and have a strong impact on his or her unusual life story. Almost every company who offered an internship has told us that it was a very enriching experience for all their employees.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">How long should an internship last?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>The average duration of an internship is 6 - 12 months. However you can also offer 3 months and decide later if you’d like to prolong it.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">What is the Career Day?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>At the Career Day, we simulate a real job-finding situation. Each company has five minutes to present the internship they wish to offer. Afterwards, each company has a booth and the participants can stop by to ask questions and introduce themselves. The goal is to invite three to five participants for an interview in the following week.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-header">Are the refugees allowed to work in Switzerland?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>Yes. Refugees with B or F permits are considered almost like Swiss welfare recipients. The state wants them to be integrated, have a job and become independent. The same goes for temporarily-admitted foreigners with F status.</p>

<p>Asylum seekers with permit N are theoretically allowed to work, but have more difficulties getting a work permit because of the priority for people living in Switzerland.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">How to get the job permit for interns?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>The Powercoders team files the applications for the job permits. The companies only have to sign the application form that we prepare for them, create the employment contract and pay the low fee (if there is one).</p>
        </div>

    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">How long is the job permit valid for?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>The work permit is limited to the duration of the internship. However, if the same company wants to offer another internship or employment subsequently, the work permit can easily be adapted accordingly. A work permit is always only valid for the employment at the company it was applied for.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">What is the recommended salary?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>After the internship we recommend a salary between CHF 60&rsquo;000 and CHF 90&rsquo;000 per year.</p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">What happens to the work permit if the internship is followed up by a apprenticeship?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>That depends on the Canton. But in most Cantons the apprenticeship needs to be recognized by the authorities and then the work permit can be issued.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">Does the company have to offer a job or an apprenticeship after the internship?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">
            <p>No. There is no obligation to employ the intern after the internship in any way. However, if you want to continue to engage with your intern but you can’t offer a job or an apprenticeship, there are several alternative options:</p>

<ul>
<li>prolong the internship up to one year</li>
<li>offer a part-time internship or job and let the intern study German part-time</li>
<li>offer a part-time internship or job while your intern is part-time studying at FH or ETH</li>
<li>share the resource with another company in the Powercoders network</li>

        <div class="collapsible-header">Does the company have to apply for a new job permit if the internship is followed up by an apprenticeship?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body markdown">

        <div class="collapsible-header">Are the participants allowed to work outside of a Canton?</div>

        <div class="collapsible-header">Who are the participants?</div>

            <p>The social welfare law of each canton regulates the amount of money social welfare recipients get. They follow the SKOS (Schweizerische Konferenz für Sozialhilfe) regulations. A recognised refugee with permit B or F living alone receives around 1000 CHF per month (accommodation and health insurance expenses not included). Temporarily admitted persons with permit F and Asylum seekers with permit N often receive much less.</p>
